If the path of chardet-config does not include the PATH environment, please
add a chardet-config directory in the PATH environment variable.

```bash
[user@host chardet]$ # if chardet-config is located in /opt/libchardet-1.0.5/bin
[user@host chardet]$ PATH="$PATH:/opt/libchardet-1.0.6/bin" make build
[user@host chardet]$ # OR
[user@host chardet]$ PATH="$PATH:/opt/libchardet-1.0.6/bin" python setup.py build
```
